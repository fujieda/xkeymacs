value "bash". Reboot Windows. By doing this, you can use M-! to run bash.

Q. I can not open File menu by Alt+F after I install XKeymacs. Why?
A. In default setting, Alt+F work as M-f.
You should uncheck M-f and/or Alt:Meta check box on Properties dialog
if you want to use Alt+F to open File menu.
Or if you depress F after releasing Alt,
File menu is opened by Alt+F when M-f and Alt:Meta are enabled.

Q.Why does the remapping indication differ from the actual system behaviour?
A. The Keyboard Layout dialog indicates the current registry data.
On the other hand, the behavior of the system reflects the registry data at the time the system started.
If you restart Windows, the system behaves the way you want.

Q. Why are some check boxes in the options dialog always disabled?
A. Some check boxes are only for Windows NT, 2000 and XP.
So they are disabled every time on Windows 95, 98 and ME.

Q. Why a mail window is closed of Microsoft Outlook Express when a user depress Esc key as Meta?
A. Assign Esc as commands "Meta" category "Other" on Advanced tab of Properties Dialog.
Esc key is assigned "Meta for Esc" on default setting.
"Meta for Esc" work not only Meta but also original key, i.e. Esc.
So Esc key work as Meta on Notepad and Esc can close a dialog,
but Esc did not work well on some application like Microsoft Outlook Express.

Q. What is the best value of kill-ring-max?
A. Default value is 30 on Emacs.

Q. Why C-y yanks last killed data only after a user execute C-k, C-k, C-k?
A. XKeymacs connects data by kill-ring when clipboard data has other than plane text.
So if kill-ring-max is 0, killed data is not connected.
Open Properties dialog and set kill-ring-max 1 and over to connect killed data.

Q. The combo box on the properties dialog shows only "set as default" IME
even if some IMEs are installed. (IME or "Input Method Editor" is a gizmo to input Japanese or some other languages).

So you can set for the IME.
